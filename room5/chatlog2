1:59:35 AM blitzkraft Oh crap! All of them?
1:59:35 AM AntneyW so, @Online_i ... I think we're the only two survivors from our group.
1:59:49 AM tehcid room1 was just me and vive..something
1:59:57 AM sixthreetwo NeoSizer, we're the only ones left from our group, too

2:00:27 AM tehcid :(
2:00:31 AM but yeah, new friends
2:00:33 AM !
2:01:09 AM blitzkraft Is anyone else interested in keeping the chat logs?
2:01:19 AM Online_i damn @AntnetW :( my original left on the second one lol
2:01:38 AM blitzkraft I'll need to sleep in the next hour.
2:01:47 AM AntneyW My original never even spoke. Haha. I didn't get anyone talking until Room3
2:01:55 AM Online_i mine neither
2:02:31 AM blitzkraft My first one was really good. We bonded really quickly until the group got about 100 users.
2:02:37 AM absurditas Aww. Ill abandon if theres no chat in a room. Its no fun!
2:02:37 AM blitzkraft All hell broke loose.
2:03:44 AM sixthreetwo 100 users is so many!
2:03:52 AM this is my first time on Robin
2:04:14 AM blitzkraft Yes it is. The largest civil conversation we had was around 40-50 users. It was a good group.
2:04:34 AM It's the first room in my repo.
2:04:48 AM sixthreetwo even 50 seems like it could make for a hectic conversation
2:05:36 AM NeoSizer voted to STAY
2:05:46 AM blitzkraft Neo!! NO!!
2:05:57 AM NeoSizer WHAT
2:06:17 AM it's majority rules
2:06:39 AM blitzkraft But I'd be happier if it were unanimous.
2:06:52 AM NeoSizer :/
2:06:55 AM NeoSizer voted to GROW
2:06:59 AM blitzkraft Thank you!
2:07:05 AM NeoSizer fine then
2:07:15 AM tehcid :)
2:08:12 AM sixthreetwo what a team player :') Neo was in MY original group
2:08:16 AM so proud
2:08:36 AM tehcid you know what'd be awesome? a family tree view showing how everyone got here
2:09:13 AM blitzkraft I'm pretty sure that data exists.
2:09:16 AM NeoSizer yeah, me and 632 go way back
2:09:20 AM blitzkraft Just a pain to manage and view.
2:09:46 AM Actually, if you guys have all the logs, we can do that ourselves.
2:10:16 AM NeoSizer I'm on moble, i have no logs
2:10:17 AM tehcid mm collation would be a pain
2:10:18 AM blitzkraft BTW, did anyone figure how the colors are assigned?
2:10:30 AM tehcid but reddit would have it all
2:10:35 AM no idea.. ooh what colour am I?
2:10:44 AM NeoSizer probably CRC
2:10:46 AM blitzkraft tehcid: orange
2:10:48 AM tehcid blitz purple, Neo green, sixthreeto blue
2:10:50 AM again!
2:10:52 AM AntneyW oh hey that's a good question. What color am i?
2:10:56 AM tehcid yellow Ant
2:11:00 AM sixthreetwo yellow
2:11:06 AM blitzkraft I thought the colors were related to the button.
2:11:09 AM tehcid :o
2:11:10 AM sixthreetwo (Neo, you're still green)
2:11:16 AM blitzkraft I was purple and now I'm purple, right?
2:11:16 AM Online_i i was a filthy purple so no its not
2:11:29 AM sixthreetwo Purple is rad! and underrated
2:11:39 AM tehcid yep blitz
2:11:39 AM NeoSizer I'll always be green
2:11:45 AM it never changes
2:11:47 AM tehcid orange master race
2:11:54 AM blitzkraft @Online: Got it. The color palette is exactly the same
2:11:55 AM https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/317c9o/thebutton_flair_color_guide/
2:12:41 AM Online_i yeah but your color here isnt the same as it was on the button
2:12:47 AM like if u pressed itt
2:13:50 AM blitzkraft I see that. I seem to draw parallels just because the colors are the same for me.
2:14:42 AM sixthreetwo gotta go afk so hopefully I don't miss voting/get kicked. if I do, it was a pleasure. Neo, stay green
2:15:03 AM Online_i cya 632
2:15:13 AM and yeah i get it, its normal :P
